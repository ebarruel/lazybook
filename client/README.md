# Lazy Book Client

## Nix

This client isn't actually fully reproducible with Nix due to its reliance on VSCode extensions for development work. This will be solved at a later date.

However, build packages should be consistent.

## Testing

Testing (Playwright) must be run with the VSCode extension, but everything else can be run normally with Bun.
